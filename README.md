## Koodaripula.com - better knowledge on the state of Finnish ICT labor market

This is a Jekyll reposotiry for an independent research project for developing better knowledge on the state of Finnish ICT employment market and for finding real world solutions for improving it. The site is initially built around a small survey executed in March 2020 and it's findings.

The site and the articles provided are in Finnish as the survey and research was done for the Finnish speaking ICT-community. However, the data used for the research has been translated and we plan to publish a short summary of our key findings in English as well.
